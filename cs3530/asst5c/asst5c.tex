\subsection*{Exercise 2.15 (5 points)}

\subsubsection*{Problem}

Give a counterexample to show that the following construction fails
to prove that the class of context-free languages is closed under
star. Let $A$ be a CFL that is generated by the CFG
$G=(V,\Sigma,R,S)$. Add the new rule $S\rightarrow SS$ and call the
resulting grammar $G'$. This grammar is supposed to generate $A^*$.

\subsubsection*{Solution}

Using a CFL: A = \{$a^nb^n: n\ \ge\ 0$\} \\

CFG G is generated: $ S\rightarrow \varepsilon\ |\  aSb $ \\

CFG G' is generated by adding the rule $ S\rightarrow SS$ 
making $ S\rightarrow \varepsilon\ |\  aSb\ |\ SS $ \\

G' will result in strings in the form of a(ab)*ba(ab)*b which is not a part of
the language A which demonstrates that the CFL isn't closed under star.



\section*{Additional problem}

Let $L$ be the language $\{w: w$ has equal numbers of $a$s, $b$s,
and $c$s$\}$
 
\begin{enumerate}[\bfseries a.]
\item Prove that $\overline{L}$ is context free (7 points)

\textbf{Solution}

Assume $\overline{L}$ is context free \\
and there is a string $s \in \overline{L}$ of at least length $p$ \\
then $s$ may be divided int $s = uvxyz$ satisfying the following conditions \\

1. for each $i \ge 0, uv^ixy^iz \in \overline{L}$ \\
2. $|vy| > 0$ \\
3. $|vxy| \le p$ \\
$\ $ \\
if $s$ is split into $s = a^{p+i} b^p c^{p+i}$ and $i > 0$ then the strings generated are found $\in \overline{L}$ and none of the rules are violated showing that our assumption of L being a CFL was true. \\ 

\item Prove that $L$ is not context free  (7 points)

\textbf{Solution}

Assume L is context free \\
and there is a string $s \in L$ of at least length $p$ \\
then $s$ may be divided int $s = uvxyz$ satisfying the following conditions \\

1. for each $i \ge 0, uv^ixy^iz \in L$ \\
2. $|vy| > 0$ \\
3. $|vxy| \le p$ \\
$\ $ \\
if $s$ is split into $s = a^{p+i} b^p c^{p+i}$ and $i > 0$ 
then the string will contain more a's and c's than b's which is not in L.
This violates the first condition which shows a condradiction which shows that our assumption of L being a CFL was false. \\ 

\item Conclude that CFLs are not closed under complement (1 point)

\textbf{Solution}

Parts a and b demonstrate the fact that part a is a CFL while part b shows by the pumping lemma that the complemt of the same language is not a CFL.
