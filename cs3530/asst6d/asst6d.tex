\subsection*{Problem 4.31 (3rd ed) (20 points)}

\subsubsection*{Problem}

Say that a variable $A$ in CFL $G$ is \textit{usable} if it appears
in some derivation of some string $w\in G$. Given a CFG $G$ and a
variable $A$, consider the problem of testing whether $A$ is usable.
Formulate this problem as a language and show that it is decidable.

\subsubsection*{Solution}

With the below example, variable A is usable by CFG G because it is the only derivation that leads to a string without variables which alows termination to occur. \\ \ \\
$L$ = \{$w$: where $w$ is in the form of $0^n\#1^n$ and n>0\} \\ 
$S \rightarrow 0S1$ \\
$S \rightarrow A$ \\
$A \rightarrow \#$ \\ \ \\
To determine if the language is decidable we can use a turing machine that can test if all variables can generate a string of terminals. Basicly it marks all terminals and when a variable is reached it marks the variable then it copies the string that terminal generates into the area that is being scanned. The string will accept when all variables and terminals are marked
