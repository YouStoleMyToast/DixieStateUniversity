csv_<table_name>.txt   Comma-separated value (CSV) text file containing
                       the values of the table <table_name> in the sample
                       database. The first row contains column names.
                       If you're unable to create and populate the tables
                       by using an SQL script, you can import each CSV 
                       file as a table (all DBMSes can import CSV files;
                       look for an Import or Load command).
